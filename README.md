## Horseless Derby  
Horseless Derby is currently a single-player game that allows one to place bets on the weighted randomized outcomes of horse races. The interface is simple:

- The Show Racers! button opens a table of five named horses and displays the oddfs of their victories.
- The Add Users button opens a modal that allows the addition of new users, which are stored in the browser's localStorage.
- The Show Users button opens a modal that displays the players and the amounts currently in their accounts.
- The Place Bets button opens a modal that allows bets to be placed from a given player's account.
- The Race! button runs the race and computes payouts.

## Current Next Steps  
- Clean up UI
- Add support for a proper database instead of relying on localStorage.
- Allow a multi-player mode, especially over the network.
